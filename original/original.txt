Work History
Fox Sports/Foxtel
August2017-Present
Web Development Manager
Javascript / CSS / Agile / recruitment / nodeJS / AWS / Atlassian suite / Wordpress / git / mentoring / architecture
I was hired to look after the web team for the Fox Sports website. Team size varied between a dozen and a half dozen 
developers. Due to us being part of NewsCorp, our backend is Wordpress which renders up a template but most of our 
work is in node and frontend javascript/css that is brought into the template using Akamai ESI.
I’ve been working on refining processes, improving team culture and cultivating a high performance team. We’ve 
increased development speed by building tooling around our general work and have been able to deliver projects 
which previously took 3 months down to 4 weeks.
Towards the end of 2020 there was a company reorg and I was moved into Foxtel. Since then I have spent nearly 2 
years working on Foxtel projects. In Foxtel I lead multiple teams developing on a Java based AEM stack, I have been 
involved in creation of automated pages for tv shows and movies, rebuilding of the design system using web 
components, and rebuilding the “my account” sections of the site.

Technical Development Manager – Network team
Javascript / CSS / Agile / recruitment / nodeJS / sitecore / AWS / teamcity CI / grunt / git / mentoring / architecture
I was promoted to the TDM role for a new team within the network team with 5 positions reporting into me. Network 
is responsible for the development of the core properties in the ninemsn suite of sites. I started my role by beginning 
the nodeJS rebuild of “Network Home” which is the internal name for ninemsn.com.au. Network Home is a property 
which has an audience of nearly 3 million, handles tens of thousands of concurrent connections at any point and is the 
most important property in the company, generating millions in advertising revenue. While we were still filling the 
positions in my team I begun the project myself, creating the project architecture and deciding upon the core 
technologies.
As my team and responsibilities grew I didn't have time to code in work hours anymore, so I made sure I stayed active 
on personal projects to keep my skills sharp. The focus of my team within network was code quality and reuse, and I 
am seen as the most technical manager within Network so I often provided technical direction at both high and low 
level. Since then I have led the architecture of the other rebuilds that followed. I was also heavily involved in 
recruitment, winning the internal “connected leader” award.

Being in a large company was good for me, I was quickly promoted to be the lead of my team in studios. I managed a 
team of 4 frontend developers and still did some development work myself. 
Management involved having one on one meetings with my direct reports each 2 weeks where I mentored and helped 
them create personal development plans. I led the recruitment effort to back-fill my replacement. I worked with the 
project managers in scheduling jobs and tracking availability. I also helped to improve development processes and 
provided technical direction for larger projects.

build each project. The company was bought out by an investment firm who decided to close the entire Australian 
branch so I was unfortunately made redundant.
