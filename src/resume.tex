After joining the company subsequent to ubank's acquisition of 86400, I was made responsible for overseeing the 
seamless migration of the ubank customer base onto the 86400 infrastructure. This process entailed the establishment
of new bank accounts for a substantial customer cohort, encompassing hundreds of thousands of individuals, and the 
successful transfer of over \$12 billion in customer funds to their respective new accounts, ensuring uninterrupted 
access to their finances.

Following the migration, my team transitioned into a dynamic feature team, actively contributing to the advancement 
of ubank's product roadmap. We designed and developed personal finance tools to track income, bills and spending as 
well as tools to budget and allocate money for our customers. Additionally, I have leveraged my expertise in fraud 
detection and transactional processes to support various projects, further enhancing organizational objectives.
