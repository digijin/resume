\section*{Work Experience}

\textbf{Morfless} \hfill \textit{December 2024 - Present} \\
Engineering Lead \\
\textit{Technologies: TypeScript, Node, AWS, DevOps, CI/CD}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supporting Morfless in uplifting their development practices.
    \item Focused on optimizing workflows, enhancing automation, and improving technical infrastructure to drive efficiency and scalability across engineering.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{86400 / ubank} \hfill \textit{March 2022 - November 2024} \\
Engineering Manager \\
\textit{Technologies: TypeScript, Node, Angular, Backend, Mobile}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed and maintained personal finance tools for tracking income, bills, spending, and budgeting.
    \item Led the migration of ubank customers to the 86400 infrastructure, managing the transfer of over \$12 billion in customer funds for 500,000 customers.
    \item Applied expertise in fraud detection and transactional processes.
    \item Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.
\end{itemize}

After joining the company subsequent to ubank's acquisition of 86400, I was responsible for overseeing the seamless migration of the ubank customer base onto the 86400 infrastructure. This process entailed the establishment of new bank accounts for a substantial customer cohort, encompassing hundreds of thousands of individuals, and the successful transfer of over \$12 billion in customer funds to their respective new accounts, ensuring uninterrupted access to their finances.

Following the migration, my team transitioned into a dynamic feature team, actively contributing to the advancement of ubank's product roadmap. We designed and developed personal finance tools to track income, bills and spending as well as tools to budget and allocate money for our customers. Additionally, I leveraged my expertise in fraud detection and transactional processes to support various projects, further enhancing organizational objectives.

Left the role due to a redundancy of the position as a result of an internal restructure.

\textbf{Fox Sports / Foxtel} \hfill \textit{August 2017 - February 2022} \\
Web Development Manager \\
\textit{Technologies: JavaScript, CSS, Node, AWS, Atlassian Suite, WordPress}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed and maintained the Fox Sports website, managing a team of 6-10 developers.
    \item Led multiple offshore teams at Foxtel, contributing to automated TV and movie pages, and rebuilding the design system.
    \item Improved development processes, reducing match center delivery time from 3 months to 4 weeks.
    \item Rebuilt the Fox Sports article page, resulting in significant search engine optimization improvements.
\end{itemize}

I was hired to look after the web team for the Fox Sports website. Team size varied between a dozen and a half dozen developers. Due to us being part of NewsCorp, our backend is Wordpress which renders up a template but most of our work is in node and frontend javascript/css that is brought into the template using Akamai ESI.

I've been working on refining processes, improving team culture and cultivating a high performance team. We've increased development speed by building tooling around our general work and have been able to deliver projects which previously took 3 months down to 4 weeks.

Towards the end of 2020 there was a company reorg and I was moved into Foxtel. Since then I have spent nearly 2 years working on Foxtel projects. In Foxtel I lead multiple teams developing on a Java based AEM stack, I have been involved in creation of automated pages for tv shows and movies, rebuilding of the design system using web components, and rebuilding the "my account" sections of the site.

\textbf{Mi9 / nineMSN / Nine} \hfill \textit{June 2014 - August 2017} \\
Technical Development Manager \\
\textit{Technologies: JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, Sitecore, AWS, Git}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Led one of two main teams responsible for building the new version of ninemsn.com.au on a NodeJS stack.
    \item Managed 6 direct reports while overseeing a group of over a dozen developers.
    \item Led the Platform team, developing underlying libraries and technologies for the ninemsn portfolio.
    \item Won the internal "Connected Leader" award for technical leadership.
\end{itemize}

I was promoted to the TDM role for a new team within the network team with 5 positions reporting into me. Network is responsible for the development of the core properties in the ninemsn suite of sites. I started my role by beginning the nodeJS rebuild of "Network Home" which is the internal name for ninemsn.com.au. Network Home is a property which has an audience of nearly 3 million, handles tens of thousands of concurrent connections at any point and is the most important property in the company, generating millions in advertising revenue. While we were still filling the positions in my team I begun the project myself, creating the project architecture and deciding upon the core technologies.

As my team and responsibilities grew I didn't have time to code in work hours anymore, so I made sure I stayed active on personal projects to keep my skills sharp. The focus of my team within network was code quality and reuse, and I am seen as the most technical manager within Network so I often provided technical direction at both high and low level. Since then I have led the architecture of the other rebuilds that followed. I was also heavily involved in recruitment, winning the internal "connected leader" award.
